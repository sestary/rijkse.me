I was born in the Netherlands and after living in Guelph and Shanghai for a few years, I moved back to Toronto to study Computer Engineering at [Seneca College](https://www.senecacollege.ca/home.html) and settled in the area and have a beautiful family.

Electronics and Computers have been a life-long passion which started with building hobby sites with PHP and hand written HTML. These websites needed a place to be hosted since "the Cloud" did not exist. This lead me to setup a [Sambar Web Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambar_Server) on my machine at home.

A friend of mine introduced me to Linux and that was it, I was never going back. I have ran some form of Linux since then running a lot of differrent services. This has allowed to to gain deep understanding of the fundamental technologies that the cloud relies on, like Linux, Networking, DNS, and Containers.

Some of the services I have setup and maintained are:

- DNS, using Bind
- File, using NextCloud
- Mail, using Postfix/Dovecot

My current interests are mainly around Infrastructure as Code (IaC) or GitOps. In my professional life I work as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer where I use tools like [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/)/[Terraform](https://terraform.io) to deploy services onto [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
